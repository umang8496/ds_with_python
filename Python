Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general purpose programming, created by Guido Van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including OOP, imperative programming, functional programming and procedural styles.

Python programs are composed of modules.
Modules contain statements.
Statements contain expressions.
Expressions create and process objects.


------------------
Keywords in Python
------------------
	import keyword as key
	print(key.kwlist)
	len(key.kwlist) --> 33

True  False  None  and  as  assert  break  class  continue  def  del  elif  else  except  finally  for  from  global
if  import  in  is  lamnbda  nonlocal  not  or  pass  raise  return  try  while  with  yield


------------------
Datatypes in Python
-------------------
In python, we are not supposed to specify the type for the variables explicitly.
Based on the value provided, the type will get assigned automatically.
Hence python is a dynamically typed language.

Each value in python has a datatype.
Since everything is an object in python, so datatypes are actually classes and variables are the instances of these classes.

int  float  bool  str  complex  list  tuple  set  dict  None

All fundamental datatypes are immutable in python.
If we change the content of these types then a new object will get created.


----------------
Python Opeartors
----------------
Arithmetic Opeartors   +  -  *  /  //  **  %
Comparison Opeartors   >  <  >=  <=  ==  !=
Logical Opeartors   and  or  not
Bitwise Opeartors   &  |  ^  ~  >>  <<
Assignment Opeartors   =  +=  -=  *=  /=  //=  %=  **=  &=  |=  ^=  >>=  <<=
Special Opeartors   is  is not  in  in not
Ternary Operators [on_true] if [expression] else [on_false] 


-------------------
Multiline Statement
-------------------
In python, end of a statement is marked by a newline character.
But we can make a statement extend over multiple lines with the line continuation character(\).
	a = 1+2+3+\
		4+5+\
		6+7+8+9

Or we could also put multiple statements ina single line using semicolon(;).
	a=1; b=2; c=3


-------------------
Docstring in Python
-------------------
Documentation string is a string that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class or method.
	def double(num):
		'''function to double the value'''
		return 2 * num

In order to get the docstring value of a module or function, we use '__doc__' or help().
	import math
	print(math.__doc__)
	print(math.sqrt.__doc__)
	help(math)


----------------
Python Functions
----------------
A function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.
Functions help break our programs into smaller and modular chunks.

	def <function_name>(<list_of_parameters>):
		'''docstring'''
		statements
		return_statement(optional)
	##END

A function can optionally have a return statement to return a value from the function.
The return statement is used to exit a function and go back to the place from where it was called.
If there is no expression in the statement or return statement itself is not present inside a function,
then the function will return the None object.

Scope of a variable is the portion of a program where the variable is recognized.
Parameters and variables defined inside a function is not visible form outside.
Hence they have a local scope.

Lifetime of a variable is the period throughout which the variable exists in the memory.
The lifetime of a variable inside a function is as long as the function executes.
They are destroyed once we return from the function.


--------------------------------
Functions with Default Arguments
--------------------------------
	def greet(name, msg):
		print('hello',name,msg)
	##END

	def greet(name, msg="how are you?"):
		print('hello',name,msg)
	##END

	def greet(*names):  # arbitrary arguments
		for name in names:
		print(names)
	##END

	greet('a','b','c','d')
	greet('x','y','z'')


-------------------
Recursion in Python
-------------------
Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.
Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.
Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some iteration.

	# factorial of a number using recursion
	def factorial(number):
		if (number == 1):
			return 1
		else:
			return factorial(number - 1)
	##END


----------------
range() function
----------------
We can generate a sequence of numbers using range() function.
Signature of range() --> range(start, stop, step)
step size is 1 by default.
This function does not store all the values in memory, it would be inefficient, rather it generates the values at run-time.
Also it cannot iterate over float objects.

	print(range(0,10)) --> range(0,10)
	print(range(0,10,2)) --> range(0,10,2)
	print(list(range(0,10,2))) -->  [0,2,4,6,8]


---------------------
Python I/O and import
---------------------
We use the print() to output data to the standard output device or console.
	print(*objects, sep='', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

'objects' is the value to be printed.
'sep' is used between the values.
After all the values are printed, 'end' gets printed. The default value is newline.
The 'file' is the object where the values are printed, and it's default value is sys.stdout

	print(1,2,3,4) --> 1,2,3,4
	print(1,2,3,4, sep'*') --> 1*2*3*4
	print(1,2,3,4, sep'*', end='&&') --> 1*2*3*4&&

	x = 12.3456789
	print('x is %3.2f', %x) --> 12.35
	print('x is %3.4f', %x) --> 12.3567

'+' symbol does not insert space character implicitly.
',' symbol does insert space character implicitly.

In python, we have the input() to take the input from the end user dynamically.
This function returns the string value, that can be converted into any required or desired format.

	number = int(input('Enter a number'))
	print(number)

When our programs grows bigger, it is a good idea to break it into different modules.
A module is a file containing python definitions and statements.
These modules can be imported to another module or the interactive interpreter in python.

In order to know about the default modules, use the following command.
	import sys
	sys.modules.keys()


-----------------
Python <int> type
-----------------
In python2, we have long datatype to represent very large integral values.
But in python3, we have only int datatype to represent all sorts of numners.

We can represent integer values in 4 formats.
Binary Format --> 0b11 or 0B11
Octal Format --> 0o11 or 0O11
Hexadecimal Format --> 0x11 or 0X11
Decimal Format --> 11


------------------
Python <bool> type
------------------
The only allowed values are True and False.
Intenally python represents True as 1 and False as 0.

bool(x)
--> if x is <int> then, 0 means False and Non-zero means True.
--> if x is <float> then, 0 means False and Non-zero floating-point number means True.
--> if x is <str> then, if x is empty the result is False otherwise True.
--> if x is <complex> then, only for (0+0j) the result is False, otherwise True.


------------------
Python <list> type
------------------
In python a list is created by placing all the elements inside a square brackets separated by commas.
It can have any number of items and they may be of different types.
Here insertion order is preserved.
	l = []
	l = [1,2,3]
	l = ['python',[1,2],(3,4),5,6,{7,8}]

Python allows negative indexing for its sequences.
	ls = [1,2,3,4,5]
	ls[0:3] --> [1,2,3]
	ls[:] --> [1,2,3,4,5]
	ls[:-1] --> [1,2,3,4]

Lists are mutable which means their elements can be changed unlike strings or tuples.

List Comprehension --> power = [2**x for x in range(10)] --> [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512]

append(-) --> adds an element to the end of the list.
extend(-) --> adds all elements of a list to another list.
insert(-,-) --> inserts an element at the specified index.
remove(-) --> removes an element from the list.
pop(-) --> removes and returns an element at the given index.
clear() --> removes all the elements from the list.
index(-) --> returns the index of the first matched item.
count(-) --> returns the number of items passed as an argument.
sort() --> sorts the list in the ascending order.
reverse() --> reverses the insertion order of the list.
copy() --> returns the shallow copy of the list.
len(-) --> returns the length of the list.
list(-) --> converts a collection into the list type.
max(-) --> returns the maximum element from the list.
mim(-) --> returns the manimum element from the list.
sum(-) --> returns the sum of the elements of the list.


-------------------
Python <tuple> type
-------------------
Tuples are similar to a list. The only difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas in a list, elements can be changed.

We generally use tuple for heterogeneous data and list for homogeneous data.
Since tuples are immutable, elements can be used as key for a dictionary.
If we have some data that does not change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected.
Also due to the immutability of the tuples, iterating over them is slightly efficient.

	tp = (1,2,3)  or tp = tuple([1,2,3])
	tp = (1, "hello", 3.14)
	a,b,c = tp --> unpacking of tuple is also possible.

	tp = (1,) --> for a creating a single-value tuple, a trailing comma should be there.

Elements of a tuple cannot be changed once it has been assigned but if the element is itself a mutable entity then it can be changed.
	tp = (1,2,[3,5])
	tp[2][1] = 4 --> (1,2,[3,4])

Elements of a tuple cannot be deleted. It can only be deleted entirely.

We can use + operator to combine two tuples. This is called concatenation.
We can also multiply tuples with numbers in order to print that tuple for those number of times.
	print((1,2,3)+(4,5,6))
	print((1,2,3)*2)

enumerate(-) --> adds counter to an iterable and returns it (the enumerate object).
				 we can convert enumerate objects to list and tuple.
		tup = ('a','b','c')
		print(enumerate(tup)) --> <enumerate object at 0x00000292D10FE4C8>
		print(list(enumerate(tup))) --> [(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c')]

len(-) --> returns the length of the list.
max(-) --> returns the maximum element from the list.
mim(-) --> returns the manimum element from the list.
sum(-) --> returns the sum of the elements of the list.
tuple(-) --> converts the collection into tuple.


-----------------
Python <str> type
-----------------
In python string is a sequence of unicode characters.
Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring uniformity in encoding.

Strings are immutable. This means that elements of a string cannot be changed once it has been assigned.
We can simply reassign different strings to the same name.

Also we cannot delete or remove the characters from the strings.
But deleting the string entirely is possible using del keyword.

encode() --> returns an encoded version of the string.
swapcase() --> swaps cases, lower case becomes upper case and vice versa.
upper() --> converts a string into upper case.
splitlines() --> splits the string at line breaks and returns a list.
replace() --> returns a string where a specified value is replaced with a specified value.
lower() --> converts a string into lower case.
islower() --> returns True if all characters in the string are lower case.
isnumeric() --> returns True if all characters in the string are numeric.
isspace() --> returns True if all characters in the string are whitespaces.
isupper() --> returns True if all characters in the string are upper case.
isdigit() --> returns True if all characters in the string are digits.
isalpha() --> returns True if all characters in the string are in the alphabet.
isalnum() --> returns True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric.
index() --> searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found.
endswith() --> returns true if the string ends with the specified value.
count() --> returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string.
find() --> searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found.

ljust(-,-) --> left justifies the string. first parameter is width and second is justification-character.
rjust(-,-) --> right justifies the string. first parameter is width and second is justification-character.
center(-,-) --> center justifies the string.

txt = "qwerty"
print(txt.center(10,'-'))  --> --qwerty--


-----------------
Python <set> type
-----------------
A set is an unordered collection of items.
Every element is unique and must be immutable.
However, the SET itself is mutable. We can add/remove/replace items from it.

A set is created by placing all the elements inside {} separated by comma or by using the built-in function set().
It can have any number of items ad they may be of different types.
But it cannot have mutable elements like list, set or dict as its elements.
	myset = {1,2,3}
	myset = {'python', 10, 101.0}
	myset = {1,1,2,3,4,3,2} --> {1,2,3,4}
	set([1,2,3,2,3]) --> {1,2,3}

Sets are mutable. But since they are unordered, indexing have no meaning.
We cannot access or change an element of set using indexing or slicing.

Creating an empty set is a bit tricky task.
	a = set() print(type(a)) --> <class 'set'>
	a = {} print(type(a)) --> <class 'dict'>

SET Operations: A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {5,6,7,8,9}
	print(A|B) --> {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
	print(A&B) --> {5}
	print(A-B) --> {1,2,3,4}
	print(B-A) --> {6,7,8,9}
	print(A^B) --> {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}

	A.union(B) --> {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
	A.intersection(B) --> {5}
	A.difference(B) --> {1,2,3,4}
	B.difference(A) --> {6,7,8,9}
	A.symmetric_difference(B) --> {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}

add(-)  clear()  pop(-)  discard(-)  remove(-)  copy()  isdisjoint(-)  issubset(-)


------------------
Python <dict> type
------------------
Python dictionary is an unordered collection of key:value pairs.
Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when key is known.

	dt = {} or dt = dict()
	dt = {1:1,2:4,3:9,4:16,5:25}
	dt = {'name':'jon','house':'targerion'}

While values can be of any datatype and can repeat, keys must be of immutable type and must be unique.
Dictionaries are mutable. We can add new items or change the value of existing items using the assignment.
If the KEY is already present, value gets updated or else a new KEY:VALUE pair is addd.
KEY can be used either inside square brackets or with get() method.
The difference while using get() is that it returns None instead of KeyError, if the key is not found.

clear() --> removes all items from the dictionary.
keys() --> returns the collection of keys as list.
values() --> returns the collection of values as list.

Dictionary Comprehension is an elegant and concise way to create a new dictionary from an iterable.
Dictionary Comprehension consists of an expression pair (K:V) followed by for statement inside {}.
	square = {x:x*x for x in range(1,6)}
	odd_square = {x:x*x for x in range(1,11) if x%2==1}

While indexing is used with other container types to access values, dictionary uses KEYS.


----------------------
Python basic functions
----------------------
type(-) --> returns the type of variable.
id(-) --> returns the address of the object.
ord(-) --> returns the unicode value of the character.
		ord('A') --> 65

isinstance(-,-) --> returns True if the object is an instance of a class or subclass; otherwise False
		isinstance(66,type(66)) --> True

eval(-,-,-) --> parses the expression passed to this method and runs python expression within the program.
		x = 1
		print(eval('x + 1')) --> 2

split(-,-) --> The split() method breaks up a string at the specified separator and returns a list of strings.
		print("abc,def,ghi".split(',')) --> ['abc','def','ghi']

join(-) --> convets iterables into string.
		print("".join(['a','b','c'])) --> abc

any(-) --> returns True if at least one element of an iterable is true, otherwise
		   False if all elements are false or if an iterable is empty.
		   any([0,0,0,0]) --> False
		   any([]) --> False

hash(-) --> returns the hash value of an object if it has one.
abs(-) --> returns the absolute value of the given number. It accepts integer, floating numbers and complex numbers.
ascii(-) --> returns a string containing printable representation of an object.
chr(-) --> returns a character from a non-negative integer (represents unicode code point of the character).

bin(-) --> returns the binary equivalent of the number.
oct(-) --> returns the octal equivalent of the number.
hex(-) --> returns the hexadecimal equivalent of the number.


---------------
lambda function
---------------
Anonymous functions are defined without name.
The normal functions are defined by using def keyword whereas anonymous functions are defined by using lambda keyword.
	lambda arg:expr

Lambda Functions can have any number of arguments but inly one expression.
Lambda Functions are used whenever function objects are required.
	double = lambda x:x*2
	f1 = lambda x,y:x+y   f1(2,3) --> 5
	f2 = lambda msg:print(msg)   f2('abc') --> abc
	power = lambda x,y : x**y
	power(5,2) --> 25

The lambdas can be used as a function shorthand that allows us to embed a function within the code.
	L = [lambda x:x**2, lambda x:x**3, lambda x:x**4]
	for f in L:
		print(f(3))
	##END

	minimum = (lambda x,y: x if x < y else y)
	minimum(101*99,102*98) --> 9996


----------------------------------
Functional Approach to Programming
----------------------------------
map() applies a function to all items in an input list.
map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs)
	items = list(range(1,6))
	squared =list(map(lambda x: x**2, items))

	def square(x):
		return x*x
	##END

	def double(x)
		return x+x
	##END

	function = [square, double]

	for i in range(6):
		value = list(map(lambda x:x(i),function))
		print(value)
	##END

filter() creates a list of elements for which a function returns True.
	number_list = range(-5,5)
	less_than_zero = list(filter(lambda x:x<0, number_list))
	print(less_than_zero)
 
reduce() is a really useful function for performing some computation on a list and returning the result.
It applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list.
	product = 1
	ls = list(range(1,5))
	for num in ls:
		product *= num
	##END

	from functools import reduce
	product = reduce((lambda x,y:x*y),list(range(1,5)))

zip() takes iterable (can be zero or more) makes iterator that aggregates elements based on the iterables passed.
It returns an iterator of tuples.

zip() returns an iterator of tuples based on the iterable objects.
	if no parameter is passed, zip() returns an empty iterator.
	if a single iterable is passed, zip() returns an iterator of 1-tuple.
	if multiple iterables are passed, then ith iterables are grouped together.

Iterator stops when shortest iterable is exhausted.
	num = [1,2,3]
	ls = ['one','two','three']
	alpha = ['a','b']
	print(zip()) --> <zip object at 0x00000205DA99F088>
	print(list(zip(num))) --> [(1,), (2,), (3,)]
	print(list(zip(num,ls))) --> [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]
	print(list(zip(num,ls,alpha))) --> [(1, 'one', 'a'), (2, 'two', 'b')]

The * operator can be used in conjunction with the zip() to unzip the list.
	coordinate = ['x','y','z']
	value = [3,4,5,0,9]
	result = zip(coordinate, value)
	print(list(result)) --> [('x', 3), ('y', 4), ('z', 5)]
	c,v = zip(*result)
	print(c,v) --> ('x','y','z') (3,4,5)

Essential Python Tips
---------------------
Reversing a string:  	stg = "abcdef"
						print("reversed string ",stg[::-1])

Method Profile:		def function():
						pass
					##END
					if __name__ == '__main__':
						import profile
						profile.run('function')
					##END

Generating Random Numbers:	import random
							for i in range(10):
								print(random.randint(1,101))
							##END

							import random as rd
							print(rd.random()) --> generates a random value between 0 an 1
							array = [rd.random(1,101) for i in range(10)]

							import random as rd
							items = [x**2 for x in range(1,6)]
							print(items) --> [1,4,9,16,25]
							rd.shuffle(items)
							print(items) --> [16,4,1,25,9]

Acessing CMD Line Argument:		from sys import argv
								print(argv[0], argv[1], argv[2])

								python test.py abc def --> test.py abc def
								python test.py 'abc def' --> test.py abc def
								python test.py "abc def" --> test.py abc def <not available>
Usually space is separator between CMD line arguments.
If our CMD line argument itself contains space then we should enclose it within double quotes.


collections.Counter()
A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

>>> from collections import Counter

>>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
>>> print Counter(myList)
Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})

>>> print Counter(myList).items()
[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]

>>> print Counter(myList).keys()
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

>>> print Counter(myList).values()
[3, 4, 4, 2, 1]

An OrderedDict is a dictionary that remembers the order of the keys that were inserted first.
If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged.

>>> from collections import OrderedDict

>>> ordinary_dictionary = {}
>>> ordinary_dictionary['a'] = 1
>>> ordinary_dictionary['b'] = 2
>>> ordinary_dictionary['c'] = 3
>>> ordinary_dictionary['d'] = 4
>>> ordinary_dictionary['e'] = 5

>>> print ordinary_dictionary
{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'e': 5, 'd': 4}

>>> ordered_dictionary = OrderedDict()
>>> ordered_dictionary['a'] = 1
>>> ordered_dictionary['b'] = 2
>>> ordered_dictionary['c'] = 3
>>> ordered_dictionary['d'] = 4
>>> ordered_dictionary['e'] = 5

>>> print ordered_dictionary
OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)])

---------------
Python Itertors
---------------
Iterators are everywhere in Python. They are elegantly implemented within for loops, comprehensions, generators etc. but hidden in plain sight.
Iterator in Python is simply an object that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.
Technically speaking, Python iterator object must implement two special methods, __iter__() and __next__(), collectively called the iterator protocol.
The iter() function (which in turn calls the __iter__() method) returns an iterator from them.

We use the next() function to manually iterate through all the items of an iterator.
When we reach the end and there is no more data to be returned, it will raise StopIteration. 

	>>> my_list = [4, 7, 0, 3]
	>>> my_iter = iter(my_list)

	>>> print(next(my_iter))
	>>> print(next(my_iter))

	## next(obj) is same as obj.__next__()
	>>> print(my_iter.__next__())
	>>> print(my_iter.__next__())

	## This will raise error, no items left
	>>> next(my_iter)

A more elegant way of automatically iterating is by using the for loop.
Using this, we can iterate over any object that can return an iterator, for example list, string, file etc.

	for element in my_list:
		print(element)

In fact the for loop can iterate over any iterable. Let's take a closer look at how the for loop is actually implemented in Python.

	for element in iterable:
	    # do something with element

Is actually implemented as:
	iter_obj = iter(iterable)
	while True:
	    try:
	        # get the next item
	        element = next(iter_obj)
	        # do something with element
	    except StopIteration:
	        # if StopIteration is raised, break from loop
	        break

So internally, the for loop creates an iterator object, iter_obj by calling iter() on the iterable.
Ironically, this for loop is actually an infinite while loop.
Inside the loop, it calls next() to get the next element and executes the body of the for loop with this value.
After all the items exhaust, StopIteration is raised which is internally caught and the loop ends. 

Building an iterator from scratch is easy in Python. We just have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__().
The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself. If required, some initialization can be performed.
The __next__() method must return the next item in the sequence. On reaching the end, and in subsequent calls, it must raise StopIteration.

	class PowerOfTwo:
	    def __init__(self, max = 0):
	        self.max = max

	    def __iter__(self):
	        self.n = 0
	        return self

	    def __next__(self):
	        if self.n <= self.max:
	            result = 2 ** self.n
	            self.n += 1
	            return result
	        else:
	            raise StopIteration

	>>> a = PowerOfTwo(4)
	>>> i = iter(a)
	>>> next(i)
	>>> next(i)
	>>> next(i)
	>>> next(i)
	>>> next(i)
	>>> next(i)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	StopIteration

The advantage of using iterators is that they save resources.
We can have infinite items (theoretically) in finite memory.
Iterator also makes our code look cool.


-----------------
Python Generators
-----------------
There is a lot of work in building an iterator in Python.
We have to implement a class with __iter__() and __next__() method, keep track of internal states, and raise StopIteration when there are no values to be returned.
This is both lengthy and counterintuitive. Generator comes to the rescue in such situations.

Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the work we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python.
Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).

It is as easy as defining a normal function, but with a yield statement instead of a return statement.
If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function.
Both yield and return will return some value from a function.

The difference is that while a return statement terminates a function entirely, yield statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.

Here is how a generator function differs from a normal function.
	Generator function contains one or more yield statements.
	When called, it returns an object (iterator) but does not start execution immediately.
	Methods like __iter__() and __next__() are implemented automatically. So we can iterate through the items using next().
	Once the function yields, the function is paused and the control is transferred to the caller.
	Local variables and their states are remembered between successive calls.
	Finally, when the function terminates, StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls.

	# A simple generator function
	def my_gen():
	    n = 1
	    print('This is printed first')
	    # Generator function contains yield statements
	    yield n

	    n += 1
	    print('This is printed second')
	    yield n

	    n += 1
	    print('This is printed at last')
	    yield n


	# Using for loop
	for item in my_gen():
	    print(item)

	This is printed first
	1
	This is printed second
	2
	This is printed at last
	3

One interesting thing to note in the above example is that the value of variable n is remembered between each call.
Unlike normal functions, the local variables are not destroyed when the function yields. Furthermore, the generator object can be iterated only once.
One final thing to note is that we can use generators with for loops directly.
This is because a for loop takes an iterator and iterates over it using next() function. It automatically ends when StopIteration is raised.

Normally, generator functions are implemented with a loop having a suitable terminating condition.
	def rev_str(my_str):
	    length = len(my_str)
	    for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):
	        yield my_str[i]

	# For loop to reverse the string
	for char in rev_str("hello"):
	    print(char)

Similar to the lambda functions which create anonymous functions, generator expressions create anonymous generator functions.
The syntax for generator expression is similar to that of a list comprehension in Python. But the square brackets are replaced with round parentheses.

The major difference between a list comprehension and a generator expression is that a list comprehension produces the entire list while the generator expression produces one item at a time.

They have lazy execution, producing items only when asked for.
For this reason, a generator expression is much more memory efficient than an equivalent list comprehension.

	my_list = [1, 3, 6, 10]

	new_list = [x**2 for x in my_list]
	generator = (x**2 for x in my_list)

	print(new_list)		# [1, 9, 36, 100]
	print(generator)	# <generator object <genexpr> at 0x7f5d4eb4bf50>

Generator expressions can be used as function arguments. When used in such a way, the round parentheses can be dropped.
	>>> sum(x**2 for x in my_list)		# 146
	>>> max(x**2 for x in my_list)		# 100

Why generators are used in Python ?
	Easy to Implement
	Memory Efficient
	Represent Infinite Stream
	Pipelining Generators

Multiple generators can be used to pipeline a series of operations. This is best illustrated using an example.
	def fibonacci_numbers(nums):
	    x, y = 0, 1
	    for _ in range(nums):
	        x, y = y, x+y
	        yield x

	def square(nums):
	    for num in nums:
	        yield num**2

	print(sum(square(fibonacci_numbers(10))))
